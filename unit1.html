  <h1>Nature of Science</h1>
  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To understand scientific concepts, you must understand science itself first. Science uses the metric system of measurement. Or also known as The International System of Units. This name is very fitting, as the metric system is used all over the world. Most countries use the metric system due to it's simplicity and felxibility. Everything in the metric system is base-ten, meaning there is ten mm in one cm, ten cm in one dm, and so on. <a href="">Link to temperatures and distances in the metric system</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In science, there is a specific set of steps used to answer a question. This set of steps is called the scientific method. First, you must identify your question. Second, you must research the topic of that question. Third, you must come up with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hypothesis&rlz=1CAJIKU_enUS967US967&oq=hypo&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i433i512l9.2097j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on">hypothesis</a>. Next, you must put your hypothesis to the test, called an experiment. And finally, you must determine if the data you gathered from your research and experiment agrees with your hypothesis. If it does, test it again to make sure. If it doesn't, you must come up with a new hypothesis and test that one. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/vortYUMFAhcxnuYE7">Link to a scientific method diagram</a></p>
